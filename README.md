# 🚚 Transportation Route Optimization Project

## 📋 Overview
This project focuses on optimizing delivery truck routes in New York City, considering real-world traffic congestion to minimize total delivery time.

We use graph-based modeling and route optimization techniques to:
- Model the city's road network
- Simulate traffic conditions
- Optimize delivery paths
- Visualize time savings before and after optimization

---

## 📁 Project Structure
- `/data/`: Contains delivery points and traffic congestion data
- `/outputs/`: Maps and visualizations of routes
- `main.ipynb`: Full working Python notebook
- `summary.pdf`: Detailed project report
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python libraries

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python 3.9+
- NetworkX
- Folium
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Geopandas

---

## 📊 Results
- Average delivery time reduced by **23%** after optimization.
- Clear visualization of old vs new routes.
- Highlights importance of dynamic route planning considering traffic.
